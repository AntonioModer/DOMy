# DOMinatrix

DOMinatrix is a DOM-like GUI framework designed for the \*awesome\* LÃ–VE framework. DOMinatrix is currently under heavy development and is in no way ready to be used by anyone. If you are currently in need of a GUI system, there are several others out there or you can build your own.

If you would like to be a part of the development of DOMinatrix, you are welcome to join discussions in the issue tracker, open your own issues, create feature requests, et cetera. We are not currently accepting pull requests until DOMinatrix has some form of visual component.

All bundled tests pass. To verify tests, simply require the test file in main.lua and run it. Test verification is printed to the console.
