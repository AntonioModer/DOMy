# DOMinatrix

DOMinatrix is a DOM-like GUI framework designed for the \*awesome\* [LÃ–VE][LOVE] framework. DOMinatrix is designed to be easy to learn and powerful to use. Design with Model-View-Control( MVC) in mind, DOMinatrix allows you to organize your user interface into any number of files based on functionality, or conglomerated into one large file not for the feint of heart. DOMinatrix sports its own custom markup syntax, style sheet syntax, and scripting API (all valid Lua!) that is comparable to modern web standards such as HTML and SCSS.
